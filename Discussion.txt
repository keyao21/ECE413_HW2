Discussion 

a) It was very hard to tell the difference for all the instruments besides the "clarinet", which I think was because the waveform was relatively simple. The bells in general didn't sound too good (which I hope was the intention?), and the subtractive synth sound had a wahwah effect so I couldn't really tell between just and equal tuning. 

b) I could only tell for the clarinet because beats were easy to hear in the equal tempered, thus making the clarinet sound better when just tuned. I think this is because the clarinet had a relatively simpler waveform? 

c) I think it was generally the same between the major and the minor. I could not tell the difference for any of the instruments besides the clarinet. 

d) I actually think the bells sounded eerie and minor-ish in the major form, so I didn't find much difference in pleasantness in either major or minor, equal or just turning.
